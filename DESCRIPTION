Description: Implements joint modeling of longitudinal biomarker trajectories and
    time-to-event outcomes using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The package
    provides tools for simultaneous analysis of biomarker dynamics and survival data,
    capturing complex temporal patterns through ODE-based trajectory modeling while
    accounting for their association with event times through shared random effects.
